# OW Version File. This file specifies the version. The line VERSION=X.Y.Z is
# used and parsed. This file has to be here every time. The VERSION needs to be
# set properly or CMake will fail.
#
# SYNTAX: * The version string always is 1.2.3
#         * With an optional postfix of "+git1234".
#           This is useful if building is done by scripts. If you want to automatically
#           add the correct Git revision, use only +gitX without number.
#         * You can add beta or release candidate flags by appending b123 or rc123 directly
#           after the version number.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you modify the file, cmake re-creates the version header. But
#            it is not able to set all library version. Please re-run cmake if
#            you change something here.
#
# Examples:
#   VERSION=1.2.0
#   VERSION=1.2.0+gitX  -> replaces the X with the current revision number
#   VERSION=1.2.0+git1234 -> here, revision number was set by the build scripts for example.
#   VERSION=1.2.0b1+gitX -> first beta version
#   VERSION=1.2.0rc1+gitX -> first release candidate version
#   VERSION=1.2.0sometext1+gitX -> even arbitrary texts are allowd. Be careful as many packaging
#                                 systems refuse to accept these arbitrary version strings.
#   VERSION=1.2.0 (gitBranch) -> Adds the current branch

# The current version string:
VERSION=1.5.0dev+gitX (gitBranch)
