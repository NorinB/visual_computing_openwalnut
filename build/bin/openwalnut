# We want to avoid that multiple system installations of OpenWalnut cause some weird loading of libs. We want ours (relative to our executable) to be loaded:

# Well, this one needs to be there! If not, your installation is wrong.
#Preloads="$LIBDIR/libopenwalnut.so.1"

# We need to ensure the libs are there. If not, do not add them to the preloads variable
#for lib in $Libs
#do
#    libfile=$LIBDIR/$lib
