    <body><p>This toolbox is an interactive tool for exploration and visualization of hierarchical clustering results of the brain cortex. Given a
        3D brain image and a dendrogram file, it visualizes a hierarchical tree and allows exploration of different partition solutions and their
        visualization in 3d voxels and slide overlay. If freesurfer surfaces are available it also projects the partition results to the 3D
        surface.</p><p>In its simplest functioning mode, here called voxel mode it requires a previously loaded 3D image such as a T1 nifti file of
        the corresponding brain, its connection to the <em>hierchClustDisplay</em> module from this toolbox and the loading of a dendrogram file
        encoding a previously computed full hierarchical clustering solution (such as the ones provided from the <em>hClustering</em> tools, soon
        available on github - for more information check indicated publications or mail to: d.mor.dom@gmail.com).  This module enables exploration of
        different partition solutions using a variety of algorithms and parameters from the <em>Cluster selections</em> command window, as well as
        exploration of the dendrogram itself interacting directly with the displayed graph and using the commands in the <em>Dendrogram</em> window. A
        3D rendering of the seed voxels can be displayed by checking the <em>render seed voxels</em> option in the <em>visualization</em> command
        window, as well as activating other interesting visual options.  Tree processing options, such as outlier pruning and node collapsing are also
        available at the corresponding command window too.  To complete the voxel visualization mode, the hierchClustDisplay module output <em>colors
        out</em> to the <em>colormapper</em> OpenWalnut module in order to overlay the selected partition results over the loaded 3D image slides (use
    no interpolation and  colormap: vector).</p><p>The partition results obtained through the hierchClustDisplay module can be displayed onto a
    freesurfer surface of the corresponding subject through the usage of the second module available on this toolbox: <em>partition2mesh</em>. This
    module takes 4 inputs, the first 2 corresponding to the two outputs of the hierchClustDisplay module. The remaining two must be connected to
    OpenWalnut <em>Read Mesh</em> modules where freesurfer surface files must be loaded. The first surface will be the projection surface: the
    partition voxel information from hierchClustDisplay will be projected through nearest neighbor interpolation to the vertices of the loaded surface
    (typically, the voxels will correspond to the gm/wm boundary and the <em>original</em> freesurfer file is recommended). The second surface will be
    visualization surface, any freesurfer surface from the same hemisphere and subject as the previously loaded can be used (pial, inflated, etc.). As
    a last step, the output of this module must be connected to the OpenWalnut module <em>Triangle Mesh Renderer</em>, and the 3D surface projection
    will be available (use Color mode: From Mesh).</p><p> Journal Papers: <ul> <li> Moreno-Dominguez D, Anwander A, Knösche TR (2014). A hierarchical
