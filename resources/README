Non-Compile Resources
=====================

This directory contains all additional files. They usually do not need to be compiled
and need to be copied to a certain place.

This directory contains directories for each component defined in the CMake files.
Ensure that the names match exactly. The SETUP_GLOBAL_RESOURCES CMake function
then searches in the directory belonging to the component. Inside this directory,
all contents will be copied to the installation dir/build dir, keeping the 
structure. This means, if the core lib needs something in share/openwalnut, 
you need to put it into resources/core/share/openwalnut.

There is one exception to the rule. The directory called "platformDependent" 
is not copied directly. It, again, contains subdirectories for each component
and inside of them, subdirectories for the platform. So, if the core needs a
certain file on windows, in directory abc, then put the file to 
resources/platformDependent/core/windows/abc. 

Platform directories allowed: linux, windows, macosx
