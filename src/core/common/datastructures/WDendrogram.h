/**
 * Hirachical binary tree datastructure with spatial layout information called dendrogram. Please note that there are some
 * limitations of this implementation: First of all there are exactly <dfn>n-1</dfn> many inner nodes, and only inner nodes may
 * have a height. In order to use this class for your objects ensure that the objects are labeled from <dfn>0,...,n-1</dfn>.
 *
 * The following description is taken from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram A dendrogram (from Greek
 * dendron "tree", -gramma "drawing") is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of
 * clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. Please note that each level has its height.
