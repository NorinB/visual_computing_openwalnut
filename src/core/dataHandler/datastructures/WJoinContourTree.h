/**
 * Processes a dataset for join tree computation. This is a part of those famous contur trees.
 *
 * Every leaf in that tree represents a local maximum. A branch is a collection of vertices belonging to the
 * same component and nodes joining branches represent a data point which melds multiple (at least two)
 * branches.
 *
 * With the Split tree then you may compute the contour tree, but for that you may need to fullfil at least two
 * conditions:
 *  - You operate on a simplicial mesh (WGridRegular3D is not simplicial!!!)
 *  - All data points are pairwise disjoint
 *
 * \note You may use this join tree also for finding the vertices belonging to the volume enclosed by the
 * biggest isosurface for a given isovalue. Then you don't need "simulation of simplicity" to make the
 * data points disjoint also you don't need simplicial meshes.
