/**
 * This is a base class for all module combination classes. The basic idea is to hide the actual combination work from others. These classes may
 * be useful in the GUI. The GUI can create a module combiner instance in a special way, with an interface the GUI wants to have. Then, the
 * kernel can construct the actual module graph out of it. Another purpose is some kind of project file loading. One can write a combiner which
 * loads projects files and creates a module graph out of it. The only think which all the combiners need to know: the target container. Derive
 * all specific combiner classes from this one.
