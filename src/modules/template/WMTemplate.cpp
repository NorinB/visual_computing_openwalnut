    // To properly understand what this is, we need to have a look at how module instances get created. At first, if you are not familiar with the
    // design patterns "Prototype", "Abstract Factory" and "Factory Method" you should probably read about them first. For short: while the kernel
    // is starting up, it also creates an instance of WModuleFactory, which creates a prototype instance of every module that can be loaded.
    // These prototypes are then used to create new instances of modules, check compatibility of modules and identify the type of modules.
    // If someone, in most cases the module container, wants a new instance of a module with a given prototype, it asks the factory class for it,
    // which uses the prototype's factory() method. Since the method is virtual, it returns a module instance, created with the correct type.
    // A prototype itself is an instance of your module, with the constructor run, as well as connectors() and properties(). What does this mean
    // to your module? Unlike the real "Prototype"- Design pattern, the module prototypes do not get cloned to retrieve a new instance,
    // they get constructed using "new" and this factory method.
    //
    // Here is a short overview of the lifetime of a module instance:
    //
    //    * constructor
    //    * connectors()
    //    * properties()
    //    * now isInitialized() will return true
    //    * the module will be associated with a container
    //    * now isAssociated() will return true
    //          o isUsable() will return true
    //    * after it got added, moduleMain() will be called
    //    * run, run, run, run
    //    * notifyStop gets called
    //    * moduleMain() should end
    //    * destructor
    //
    // So you always have to write this method and always return a valid pointer to an object of your module class.
    // Never initialize something else in here!

    // How will your module know on which data it should work? Through its input connector(s). How will other modules get to know about your
    // calculated output data? Through your output connector(s). Simple isn't it? You may assume your module as some kind of function, as in
    // common programming languages, where your connectors denote its function signature. The method "connectors()" is for initializing your
    // connectors, your function signature. Now, a short excursion on how the module container and kernel knows which connector can be connected
    // to which. Generally, there are only two types of connectors available for your usage: WModuleInputData and WModuleOutputData and they can
    // only be connected to each other. So, it is not possible to connect an input with an input, nor an output with an output. Both of them are
    // template classes and therefore are associated with a type. This type determines if an input connector is compatible with an output connector.
    // A simple example: assume you have a class hierarchy:
    // Initialize your connectors here. Give them proper names and use the type your module will create or rely on. Do not use types unnecessarily
    // high in class hierarchy. The list of your connectors is fixed after connectors() got called. As in common imperative programming languages
    // the function signature can not be changed during runtime (which, in our case, means after connectors() got called).

    // Here is an example of how to create connectors. This module wants to have an input connector. This connector is defined by the type of
    // data that should be transferred, a module-wide unique name and a proper description:
    m_input = WModuleInputData< WDataSetSingle >::createAndAdd( shared_from_this(), "in", "The dataset to display" );

    // This creates an input connector which can receive WDataSetSingle. It will never be able to connect to output connectors providing just a
    // WDataSet (which is the father class of WDataSetSingle), but it will be able to be connected to an output connector with a type derived
    // from WDataSetSingle (like WDataSetScalar or WDataSetVector)

    // Now, lets add an output connector. We want to provide data calculated here to other modules. The output connector is initialized the same
    // way as input connectors. You need the type, the module-wide unique name and the description. The type you specify here also determines
    // which input connectors can be connected to this output connector: only connectors with a type equal or lower in class hierarchy.
    m_output = WModuleOutputData < WDataSetSingle  >::createAndAdd( shared_from_this(), "out", "The calculated dataset" );

    // modules using yours. Properties NEED to be created and added here. Doing this outside this function will lead to severe problems.
    //
    // Theoretically, you can specify properties of every type possible in C++. Therefore, see WPropertyVariable. But in most cases, the
    // predefined properties (WPropertyTypes.h) are enough, besides being the only properties shown and supported by the GUI.
    //
    // To create and add a new property, every module has a member m_properties. It is a set of properties this module provides to the outer
    // world. As with connectors, a property which not has been added to m_properties is not visible for others. Now, how to add a new property?

    m_propCondition = std::shared_ptr< WCondition >( new WCondition() );
    m_aTrigger         = m_properties->addProperty( "Do it now!",               "Trigger Button Text.", WPVBaseTypes::PV_TRIGGER_READY,
                                                    m_propCondition );

    m_enableFeature    = m_properties->addProperty( "Enable feature",           "Description.", true );
    m_anInteger        = m_properties->addProperty( "Number of shape rows",     "Number of shape rows.", 10, m_propCondition );
    m_anIntegerClone   = m_properties->addProperty( "CLONE!Number of shape rows",
                                                    "A property which gets modified if \"Number of shape rows\" gets modified.", 10 );
    m_aDouble          = m_properties->addProperty( "Shape radii",              "Shape radii.", 20.0, m_propCondition );

    m_aPosition        = m_properties->addProperty( "Somewhere",                "Description.", WPosition( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ) );

    // These lines create some new properties and add them to the property list of this module. The specific type to create is determined by the
    // initial value specified in the third argument. The first argument is the name of the property, which needs to be unique among all
    // properties of this group and must not contain any slashes (/). The second argument is a description. A nice feature is the possibility
    // to specify an own condition, which gets fired when the property gets modified. This is especially useful to wake up the module's thread
    // on property changes. So, the property m_anInteger will wake the module thread on changes. m_enableFeature and m_aColor should not wake up
    // the module thread. They get read by the update callback of this modules OSG node, to update the color. m_aTrigger is a property which can
    // be used to trigger costly operations. The GUI shows them as buttons with the description as button text. The user can then press them and
    // the WPropTrigger will change its state to PV_TRIGGER_TRIGGERED. In the moduleMain documentation, you'll find a more detailed description
    // of how to use trigger properties. Be aware, that these kind of properties should be used carefully. They somehow inhibit the update flow
    // through the module graph.
    //
    // m_anIntegerClone has a special purpose in this example. It shows that you can simply update properties from within your module whilst the
    // GUI updates itself. You can, for example, set constraints or simply modify values depending on input data, most probably useful to set
    // nice default values or min/max constraints.

    // All these above properties are not that usable for selections. Assume the following situation. Your module allows two different kinds of
    // algorithms to run on some data and you want the user to select which one should do the work. This might be done with integer properties but it
    // is simply ugly. Therefore, properties of type WPropSelection are available. First you need to define a list of alternatives:
    m_possibleSelections = std::shared_ptr< WItemSelection >( new WItemSelection() );
    m_possibleSelections->addItem( "Beer", "Cold and fresh.", template_bier_xpm );          // NOTE: you can add XPM images here.
    m_possibleSelections->addItem( "Steaks", "Medium please.",  template_steak_xpm );
    m_possibleSelections->addItem( "Sausages", "With Sauerkraut.", template_wurst_xpm );

    // This list of alternatives is NOT the actual property value. It is the list on which so called "WItemSelector" instances work. These
    // selectors are the actual property. After you created the first selector instance from the list, it can't be modified anymore. This ensures
    // that it is consistent among multiple threads and selection instances. The following two lines create two selectors as initial value and
    // create the property:
    m_aSingleSelection = m_properties->addProperty( "I like most",  "Do you like the most?", m_possibleSelections->getSelectorFirst(),
                                                    m_propCondition );
    m_aMultiSelection  = m_properties->addProperty( "I like", "What do you like.", m_possibleSelections->getSelectorAll(),
                                                    m_propCondition );

    // The last examples showed you how to create more or less complex selections. You where able to define a name, description and some icon for
    // each selectable item. But maybe you want to store additional information, a class implementing some function (like a strategy pattern),
    // and similar. To achieve this, we provide a special item class called WItemSelectionItemTyped. It is a templatized class which allows you
    // to add a value of an arbitrary type to each item. This value of an arbitrary type might be a pointer, string, int, or a custom class'
    // instance.
    m_possibleSelectionsUsingTypes = WItemSelection::SPtr( new WItemSelection() );
    m_possibleSelectionsUsingTypes->addItem( MyItemType::create(
                "The value 1",  // this is the value for the type we specified: std::string.
                "Option 1",
                "Description for the first option"
        )
    );
    m_possibleSelectionsUsingTypes->addItem( MyItemType::create(
                "The value 2",  // this is the value for the type we specified: std::string.
                "Option 2",
                "Description for the second option"
        )
    );
    // This now created the selections. We store a string inside each item. But remember again: this can by ANY type.
    // Finally, add a property by specifying the selector of the selection:
    m_aSingleSelectionUsingTypes = m_properties->addProperty( "Choose one", "Choose on of these and watch the console output.",
                                                              m_possibleSelectionsUsingTypes->getSelectorFirst(), m_propCondition );

    // There are more property types available. Check out core/common/WPropertyTypes.h. One last to mention here is the WPropInterval. This
    // property type allows you to define intervals. You can create one in the same way you created the other properties:
    m_anInterval = m_properties->addProperty( "Interval", "Choose some interval please", WIntervalDouble( -1.0, 100.0 ), m_propCondition );
    // Important to know is that you can only use WIntervalDouble. You can also use make_interval, which works similar to std::make_pair.

    // Adding a lot of properties might confuse the user. Using WPropGroup, you have the possibility to group your properties together. A
    // WPropGroup needs a name and can provide a description. As with properties, the name should not contain any "/" and must be unique.

    m_group1        = m_properties->addPropertyGroup( "First Group",  "A nice group for grouping stuff." );
    m_group1a       = m_group1->addPropertyGroup(     "Group 1a", "A group nested into \"Group 1\"." );
    m_group2        = m_properties->addPropertyGroup( "Second Group",  "Another nice group for grouping stuff." );

    // You can nest property groups arbitrarily deep. ( But as with a good text, a chapter number 1.23.23.5.73.1.5 is useless. Avoid nesting too
    // deep and avoid groups with only one or two properties. )
    WPropGroup group = m_properties->addPropertyGroup( "Group Nesting - Level 0", "Demo for intensive group nesting." );
    for( int d = 1; d <= 20; ++d )
    {
        std::string depth = string_utils::toString( d );
        group = group->addPropertyGroup( "Group Nesting - Level " + depth, "A nested group." );
        // NOTE: the last group will be deleted as we do not keep its shared_ptr.
    }

    // To understand how the groups can be used, you should consider that m_properties itself is a WPropGroup! This means, you can use your newly
    // created groups exactly in the same way as you would use m_properties.
    m_group1Bool    = m_group1->addProperty( "Funny stuff", "A grouped property", true );

    // You even can add one property multiple times to different groups:
    m_group2->addProperty( m_aColor );
    m_group1a->addProperty( m_aDouble );
    m_group1a->addProperty( m_enableFeature );

    // Properties can be hidden on the fly. The GUI updates automatically. This is a very useful feature. You can create properties which depend
    // on a current selection and blend them in our out accordingly.
    m_aHiddenInt = m_group2->addProperty( "Hide me please", "A property used to demonstrate the hidden feature.", 1, true );
    m_aHiddenGroup = m_group2->addPropertyGroup( "Hide me please too", "A property used to demonstrate the hidden feature.", true );

    // Add another button to group2. But this time, we do not want to wake up the main thread. We handle this directly. Fortunately,
    // WPropertyVariable offers you the possibility to specify your own change callback. This callback is used for hiding the m_aColor property
    // on the fly.
    m_hideButton = m_group2->addProperty( "(Un-)Hide", "Trigger Button Text.", WPVBaseTypes::PV_TRIGGER_READY,
                                          boost::bind( &WMTemplate::hideButtonPressed, this ) );

    // How can the values of the properties be changed? You can take a look at moduleMain where this is shown. For short: m_anInteger->set( 2 )
    // and m_anInteger->get().

    // The properties offer another nice feature: property constraints. You can enforce your properties to be in a special range, to not be
    // empty, to contain a valid directory name and so on. This is done with the class WPropertyVariable< T >::WPropertyConstraint. There are
    // several predefined you can use directly: WPropertyConstraintTypes.h. The constants defined there can be used as namespace in
    // WPropertyHelper. As an example, we want the property m_aFile to only contain existing directories:
    WPropertyHelper::PC_PATHEXISTS::addTo( m_aFile );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_ISDIRECTORY::addTo( m_aFile );

    // Thats it. To set minimum and maximum value for a property the convenience methods setMin and setMax are defined. setMin and setMax are
    // allowed for all property types with defined <= and >= operator.
    m_anInteger->setMin( 1 );
    m_anInteger->setMax( 15 );
    m_aDouble->setMin( 5.0 );
    m_aDouble->setMax( 50.0 );

    // we also want to constraint the both selection properties. One should not allow selecting multiple elements. But both require at least one
    // element to be selected:
    WPropertyHelper::PC_SELECTONLYONE::addTo( m_aSingleSelection );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_NOTEMPTY::addTo( m_aSingleSelection );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_SELECTONLYONE::addTo( m_aSingleSelectionUsingTypes );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_NOTEMPTY::addTo( m_aSingleSelectionUsingTypes );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_NOTEMPTY::addTo( m_aMultiSelection );

    // The most amazing feature is: custom constraints. Similar to OSG update callbacks, you just need to write your own PropertyConstraint class
    // to define the allowed values for your constraint. Take a look at the StringLength class in this module's code on how to do it.
    m_aString->addConstraint( std::shared_ptr< StringLength >( new StringLength ) );
    WPropertyHelper::PC_NOTEMPTY::addTo( m_aString );

    // One last thing to mention is the active property. This property is available in all modules and represents the activation state of the
    // module. In the GUI this is simply a checkbox beneath the module. The active property should be taken into account in ALL modules.
    // Visualization modules should turn off their graphics. There are basically three ways to react on changes in m_active, which is the member
    // variable for this property.
    // 1: overwrite WModule::activate() in your module
    // 2: register your own handler: m_active->getCondition()->subscribeSignal( boost::bind( &WMTemplate::myCustomActiveHandler, this ) );
    // 3: react during your module main loop using the moduleState: m_moduleState.add( m_active->getCondition );
    // Additionally, your can also use the m_active variable directly in your update callbacks to en-/disable some OSG nodes.
    // This template module uses method number 1. This might be the easiest and most commonly used way.

    // Sometimes it is desirable to provide some values, statistics, counts, times, ... to the user. This would be possible by using a property
    // and set the value to the value you want to show the user. Nice, but the user can change this value. PropertyConstraints can't help here,
    // as they would forbid writing any value to the property (regardless if the module or the user wants to set it). In other words, these
    // special properties serve another purpose. They are used for information output. Your module already provides another property list only
    // for these kind of properties. m_infoProperties can be used in the same way as m_properties. The only difference is that each property and
    // property group added here can't be modified from the outside world. Here is an example:
    m_aIntegerOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "Run count", "Number of run cycles the module made so far.", 0 );
    // Later on, we will use this property to provide the number of run cycles to the user.
    // In more detail, the purpose type of the property gets set to PV_PURPOSE_INFORMATION automatically by m_infoProperties. You can, of course,
    // add information properties to your custom groups or m_properties too. There, you need to set the purpose flag of the property manually:
    std::string message = std::string( "Hey you! Besides all these parameters, you also can print values, " ) +
                          std::string( "<font color=\"#00f\" size=15>html</font> formatted strings, colors and " ) +
                          std::string( "so on using <font color=\"#ff0000\">properties</font>! Isn't it <b>amazing</b>?" );

    m_aStringOutput = m_group1a->addProperty( "A message", "A message to the user.", message );
    m_aStringOutput->setPurpose( PV_PURPOSE_INFORMATION );
    // This adds the property m_aStringOutput to your group and sets its purpose. The default purpose for all properties is always
    // "PV_PURPOSE_PARAMETER". It simply denotes the meaning of the property - its meant to be used as modifier for the module's behavior; a
    // parameter.
    //
    // Some more examples. Please note: Although every property type can be used as information property, not everything is really useful.
    m_infoProperties->addProperty( m_aStringOutput );   // we can also re-add properties
    m_aTriggerOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "A trigger", "Trigger As String", WPVBaseTypes::PV_TRIGGER_READY );
    m_aDoubleOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "Some double", "a Double. Nice isn't it?", 3.1415 );
    m_aIntOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "Some int", "a int. Nice isn't it?", 123456 );
    m_aColorOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "A color", "Some Color. Nice isn't it?", WColor( 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0 ) );
    m_aFilenameOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "Nice file", "a Double. Nice isn't it?", WPathHelper::getAppPath() );
    m_aSelectionOutput = m_infoProperties->addProperty( "A selection", "Selection As String",  m_possibleSelections->getSelectorFirst() );
    // One important note regarding information properties. If a property gets added in a group which is an information property-group, then
    // each added property does NOT contain any constraints. If a property gets an information property AFTER its creation, like m_aStringOutput,
    // then it keeps its constraints!

    // We now add another trigger. Pressing this button will cause an exception to be thrown. This demonstrates how the GUI and OpenWalnut
    // handles modules which throw an exception without catching it.

    // in mind, that this method is running in its own thread.

    // You can output log messages everywhere and any time in your module. The WModule base class therefore provides debugLog, infoLog, warnLog
    // and errorLog. You can use them very similar to the common std::cout streams.
    debugLog() << "Entering moduleMain()";

    // Your module can notify everybody that it is ready to be used. The member function ready() does this for you. The ready state is especially
    // useful whenever your module needs to do long operations to initialize. No other module can connect to your module before it signals its

    // Your module can use a moduleState variable to wait for certain events. Most commonly, these events are new data on input connectors or
    // changed properties. You can decide which events the moduleState should handle. Therefore, use m_moduleState.add( ... ) to insert every
    // condition you want to wait on. As every input connector provides an changeCondition, we now add this condition to the moduleState:
    m_moduleState.setResetable( true, true );
    m_moduleState.add( m_input->getDataChangedCondition() );
    // Remember the condition provided to some properties in properties()? The condition can now be used with this condition set.

    // One note about "setResetable": It might happen, that a condition fires and your thread does not currently waits on it. This would mean,
    // that your thread misses the event. The resettable flag for those condition sets can help here. Whenever a condition, managed by the
    // condition set, fires, the moduleState variable remembers it. So, the next call to m_moduleState.wait() will immediately return and reset
    // the "memory" of the moduleState. For more details, see:

    // Most probably, your module will be a module providing some kind of visual output. In this case, the WGEManagedGroupNode is very handy.

    // an osg::MatrixTransform. The transformation feature comes in handy if you want to transform your whole geometry according to a dataset
    // coordinate system for example. Another nice feature in WGEManagedGroupNode is that it can handle the m_active flag for you. Read the
    // documentation of WMTemplate::activate for more details.
    // First, create the node and add it to the main scene. If you insert something into the scene, you HAVE TO remove it after your module
    // has finished!

    // way to manipulate an OSG node while it is inside the scene. This module contains several of these callbacks as an example. The one used
    // here is to translate the root node coordinate system in space according to m_aPosition:
    m_rootNode->addUpdateCallback( new TranslateCallback( this ) );
    // Insert to the scene:

    // After your module has signalled that it is ready, OpenWalnut allows the project loader to set the restored properties and connections. For
    // you this means that your module now runs but WHILE running, the project loader might change properties and connections. Usually, this is
    // no problem as you write interactive modules, handling these changes fast. But if you need to ensure that you do not continue your module
    // until the project file loader has completely restored your module, you will need to call this:
    waitRestored();

    // Before we begin, we finally create a shader object which shades the graphics we create in this module. You can use your own shaders or a

        // Now, we can check the input, whether there is an update enqueued for us. But first, we need to understand the meaning of an update on
        // an input connector:
        //  * a module updates its output connector with some new data -> updated
        //  * a module triggers an update on its output connector without an actual data change -> updated
        //  * our own input connector got connected to an output connector -> updated
        //  * our own input connector got DISconnected from an output connector -> NO update
        // You now might ask: "Why can modules trigger updates if they did not change the data?". The answer is simple. Some modules change the
        // grid without actually changing the data for example. They translate the grid in space. This results in an update although the actual
        // data stayed the same.

        // To query whether an input was updated, simply ask the input:
        bool dataUpdated = m_input->updated();

        // Remember the above criteria. We now need to check if the data is valid. After a connect-update, it might be NULL.
        std::shared_ptr< WDataSetSingle > dataSet = m_input->getData();

        // After calling getData(), the update flag is reset and false again. Please keep in mind, that the module lives in an multi-threaded
        // world where the update flag and data can change at any time. DO NEVER use getData directly in several places of your module as the
        // data returned may change between two consecutive calls! Always grab it into a local variable and use this variable.

        // Another important hint. For grabbing the data, use a local variable wherever possible. If you use a member variable, the data might
        // never be freed if nobody uses the data anymore because your module holds the last reference. If you need to use a member variable for
        // the received data, subscribe the your input's disconnect signal or overwrite WModule::notifyConnectionClosed and reset your variable
        // there to ensure its proper deletion.
