The main purpose of the <b>Transfer Function 2D</b> module is to provide an
interface that allows the user to create and edit two-dimensional transfer functions.</p>

<p>The most important and also most complex of its properties is the <b><i>Transfer
Function</i></b> property. The following image shows the property after the user has
already done some editing.</p>

<p>
    The background shows a representation of a 2D histogram with a logarithmic bin count.
    The histogram is generated based on the two connected data sets.
    <b>Please note that the origin (0, 0) is in the top left corner!</b>
    <b>
        The values of the first
        data set are shown on the y-axis with low values on the top and high values on the bottom.
        The values of the second data set are shown on the x-axis from left (low) to right (high).

<h4>Property Descriptions</h4>
<p>
<b>Opacity Scale:</b>
    Value between 0 and 1 which is multiplied with the opacity of the widgets.
    The scaling factor for the opacity.

<b>No. samples:</b>
    The size of the 2D texture. Default is 128x128 LUT entries.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
    By right clicking the histogram the user gets the option to add a transfer function
    manipulation widget. Currently, there is only a box widget available. By clicking and
    dragging an added widget the user is able to move the widget within the boundary of the
    histogram. The box widget has four control points, one in every corner, which can be dragged
    to manipulate the size and shape of the box. By double clicking a widget with the left mouse button,
    the user has the option the select the color and opacity(alpha) for the widget.
    There is also the option to clear the transfer function by right clicking the histogram
    and select "Clear transfer function" from the context menu. In the future there will be more
    manipulation widgets to select from.
