OpenWalnut Packaging - README
*****************************

This directory contains several helpers and configurations for building
OpenWalnut source and binary packages. These scripts/configs ease the release-
management and reduce the manual overhead.

Basically, there are three important scripts for _automatically_ building and
packaging OpenWalnut. Here is an overview:

1. owpack - wrapping the build and packaging process. This script does 
   everything needed for building and packaging. It allows building DEB, RPM 
   and TGZ packages directly. It utilized the correct tools for each
   different package and system.

2. owbuildchroot - provides the build environment. This script prepares a
   build-chroot environment for a given distribution and architecture. This way,
   we can build packages for different distributions by utilizing a chroot
   environment containing the target distribution (and architecture). We can
   ensure that OpenWalnut builds on these distributions properly and are able to
   ensure, that our listed requirements are sufficient, since the build-chroot 
   is a minimal system which only contains the needed packages.

3. release - automates building and packaging for multiple distributions and
   architectures using owpack and owbuildchroot. This basically calls
   owbuildchroot for each defined architecture, distribution and supported
   package-type. It creates complete logs of the build/package process and
   allows them to be mailed to the package maintainer(s) afterwards. This can be
   run as cronjob to automatically have daily/weekly or release builds.
