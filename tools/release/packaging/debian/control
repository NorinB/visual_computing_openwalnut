Description: Framework for multi-modal medical and brain data visualization
 OpenWalnut is a tool for multi-modal medical and brain data visualization. Its
 universality allows it to be easily extended and used in a large variety of
 application cases. It is both, a tool for the scientific user and a powerful
 framework for the visualization researcher. Besides others, it is able to load
 NIfTI data, VTK line data and RIFF-format CNT/AVR-files. OpenWalnut provides
 many standard visualization tools like line integral convolution (LIC),
 isosurface-extraction, glyph-rendering or interactive fiber-data exploration.
 The powerful framework of OpenWalnut allows researchers and power-users to
 easily extend the functionality to their specific needs.
 .
 This package contains the core API of OpenWalnut.
